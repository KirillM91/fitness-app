## Info

This is a school project done at Medieinstitutet. 

The idea behind the project was to create a fitness/weightlifting application. In this app a user would be able to create exercise routines and track their progress in the gym. In addition to that the user would be able to look through a whole database of exercises, to find inspiration or see how a particular exercise is done correctly.
